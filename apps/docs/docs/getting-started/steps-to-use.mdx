# Steps to Use Mail Bridge

1. **Sign up on Mail Bridge:** Create an account on Mail Bridge by providing your `name, email, and password`. This will grant you access to the platform's features and functionality.

2. **Navigate to the Dashboard:** Upon signing up, you will be directed to the dashboard. Here, you can view all the relevant statistics related to your account usage and access other account-related information.

3. **Verify Your Account:** It is essential to verify your account with Google. To do this, visit your profile from the sidebar and follow the instructions for account verification. This step is necessary to enable email sending.

4. **Create APIs:** Generate API keys to authenticate your requests. Each API key allows for `up to 500 emails` to be sent. Use the provided API creation functionality to generate the necessary keys for your application.

5. **Create Email Templates:** Design and create customized email templates using the Handlebars format. These templates will determine the structure and content of the emails you send. The first template you create will serve as the default template for your emails.

6. **Send Emails:** Utilize the `POST` route to send requests with the required data. The Mail Bridge system will handle the email delivery to both your customers and yourself. Ensure that the necessary data is included in the request for successful email transmission.

## Guide to make requests with different clients

Fetch API and Axios are powerful options for making requests in web development. Fetch API is a built-in browser API with a versatile interface, while Axios is a popular third-party library with a user-friendly API and additional features. Both enable effective communication with servers and data retrieval.
You can use either of these to make your form working with mail bridge. Below is the code snippets explaining about both of the clients.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="fetch" label="Using Javascript Fetch API">

```js
fetch('MAIL_BRIDGE_URL', {
  method: 'post',
  headers: new Headers({
    'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  }),
  body: {
    data: YOUR_DATA_AS_OBJECT,
  },
})
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="axios" label="Using Axios">

```js
const response = await axios.post('MAIL_BRIDGE_URL', YOUR_DATA_AS_OBJECT, {
  headers: {
    'x-api-key': 'YOUR_API_KEY',
  },
})
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
